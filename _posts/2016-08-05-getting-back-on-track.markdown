So I just wanted to write a quick post to fill in where I've been the past few months.

The last 2 months have been quite the whirlwind, I have gotten married, bought a RV and went on a honeymoon to Whistler (where I got to do some awesome downhill mountain biking). During all of this my studies with have slowed, but I have refused to let them come to a halt in order to stay ready to pick things back up now that life is finally settling back down.

Starting tomorrow I will be back to studying full-time so you can expect to see more blog posts and update now that I am reconnected to my computer and the internet. I am excited to get to deep dive back into programming and spend the next few months immersed in my studies.

I'll be sure to post more soon!

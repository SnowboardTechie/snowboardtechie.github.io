Over the last 2 days, I created a simple website for managing snowboard quivers. Built using Sinatra and ActiveRecord it allows users to create and manage their own snowboards organized by categories of their choosing. Users can also view each other's categories but can only modify their own.

Currently, it is pretty ugly but I have been mainly focused on functionality. I think in the future I will spruce up the looks, but at the moment it works and that's what matters.

If you would like to try running it on your own computer or checking out the code go to <a href="https://github.com/SnowboardTechie/sb-quiver" target="_blank">https://github.com/SnowboardTechie/sb-quiver</a> and let me know what you think!
